# Flutter Event Channels Tutorial

This is a companion repo for a tutorial [blog post](). The project demonstrates usage of cross language event channels in Flutter. 

Feel free to take a look if you'd like to learn how to call Dart event channels from Java or Objective-C code.

Let us know if you think we have made some mistakes. :)
