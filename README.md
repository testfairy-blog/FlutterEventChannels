# Flutter Callbacks Tutorial

This is a companion repo for a tutorial [blog post](https://blog.testfairy.com/native-cummunication-with-a-callback-in-flutter/). The project demonstrates usage of cross language callbacks in Flutter. 

Feel free to take a look if you'd like to learn how to call Dart callbacks from Java or Objective-C code.

Let us know if you think we have made some mistakes. :)

Forked from [FlutterPluginPlayground](https://github.com/testfairy-blog/FlutterPluginPlayground) for easy bootstrapping.
